Software Engineering I
This is my project and service.

The "project" aspect allows users to select body regions and recommends a list of exercises based on that region.
The user can then select and exercise for more information (equipment, description, etc).
The project is located at the root ("/") route.

The "service" aspect retrieves a musical artist's discography, ordered by year of release.
The service is located at the "/fetch/<artist_name>" route.
